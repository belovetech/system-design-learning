# Strategy Pattern

#### Implementing Ducks with inheritance

Inheritance didn't work well

- Behaviour change across subclasses and some subclasses do not need some behaviour

#### Implementing Ducks with interface

Interface didn't work well

- Interface does not supply implmentation, hence, destroy code reuse
